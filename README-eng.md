#SPORT EQUIPMENT SALES
##sport-equipment-sales
- Contains a fictitious dataset of sports equipment sales from 2018 to 2024. It includes yearly sales data for several types of sports equipment from various brands and suppliers. Based on this data, I will perform an analysis to provide insights to store owners, brands, and suppliers of sports equipment. My plan includes presenting visualizations related to year-on-year growth, market shares, profit YTD (Year-To-Date), and profit MAT (Moving Annual Total).
- Create a summary of sports equipment sales each year, highlighting the percentage of sales growth for each year. Increasing sales will be represented in shades of blue, with darker blue indicating higher growth, while decreasing sales will be represented in shades of red, with darker red indicating greater decline from the previous year.
- Develop a graph that displays which sports equipment brand performed best in sales for the respective year.
- Add tables for profit YTD and profit MAT so that the sales team can analyze their sales performance.
- Create a dashboard for Profit YTD (Year-To-Date) and Profit MAT (Moving Annual Total) to facilitate analysis of the available data.
- Business insights and recommendations are created from data processing to make it easier for business owners to make decisions.
